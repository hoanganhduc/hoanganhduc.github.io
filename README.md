This is the source of my [personal webpage](https://hoanganhduc.github.io/) that is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com), automatically generated with [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). See [README.old.md](README.old.md) for an old (and probably still be useful) instruction on how to setup and use Jekyll ([version 3.3.0](https://jekyllrb.com/news/2016/10/06/jekyll-3-3-is-here/)) in Windows and Linux.
