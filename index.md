  <p class="mb-4">You ask me if an ordinary person&#8212;by studying hard&#8212;would get to be able to imagine these things like I imagine. Of course. I was an ordinary person who studied hard. There's no miracle people. It just happens they got interested in this thing, and they learned all this stuff. They're just people. There's no talent or special miracle ability to understand quantum mechanics or a miracle ability to imagine electromagnetic fields that comes without practice and reading and learning and study. So if you take an ordinary person who's willing to devote a great deal of time and study and work and thinking and mathematics, then he's become a scientist.</p>

* As of February 01, 2023, I am a *Lecturer* at [VNU-HUS](http://hus.vnu.edu.vn/) (Hanoi, Vietnam). 
<!--In 2024, I also visit [VIASM](https://viasm.edu.vn) (supported by [VIAMS's one-year postdoctoral fellowship](https://viasm.edu.vn/en/information-for-applicants/call-for-applicants/detail/announcement-call-for-proposals-2024)).-->
* From September 05, 2018 to December 31, 2018, I was a *Lecturer* at [VNU-HUS](http://hus.vnu.edu.vn/) (Hanoi, Vietnam). From April 01, 2019 to June 15, 2021, I was a *Postdoc* (partially supported by KAKENHI Grant Number [19K24349](https://kaken.nii.ac.jp/grant/KAKENHI-PROJECT-19K24349/)) and then a *Research Assistant* (from April 01, 2021) at [Kyutech](https://www.kyutech.ac.jp) (Fukuoka, Japan) under the direction of [Toshiki SAITOH](https://toshikisaitoh.github.io/webpage/). From June 16, 2021 to January 31, 2023, I was a *Postdoc* at [Kyoto University](https://www.kyoto-u.ac.jp/) (Kyoto, Japan) under the direction of [Shin-ichi MINATO](http://www.lab2.kuis.kyoto-u.ac.jp/minato), in the [B01 Group](https://afsa.jp/en/member/#b01) of the [AFSA Project](https://www.afsa.jp/en/) (supported by KAKENHI Grant Number [20H05964](https://kaken.nii.ac.jp/en/grant/KAKENHI-PLANNED-20H05964/)). (See also [my (deleted) profile in KyotoU's database](https://web.archive.org/web/20220702024653/https://kdb.iimc.kyoto-u.ac.jp/profile/en.5844068fa96cdf8c.html) and [my brief introduction in AFSA News Letter No. 4 (Oct. 2022)]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/misc/AFSA_News_Letter/AFSA_no4_web.pdf"}}).)
* I received the B.Math degree ([Advanced Undergraduate Program in Mathematics](http://mim.hus.vnu.edu.vn/sites/default/files/KCT_TTToan_Final.pdf)) from [VNU-HUS](http://hus.vnu.edu.vn/) (Hanoi, Vietnam) in 2013, and the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees ([Information Science](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/english/areas/information-science.html)) respectively in 2015 and 2018 from [JAIST](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/) (Ishikawa, Japan) under the advice of [Ryuhei UEHARA](https://www.jaist.ac.jp/~uehara/).

* Some [events]({% link events.md %}) where my co-author(s) or I gave a (oral/poster) presentation of our research.
* Some other [activities]({% link activities.md %}).
